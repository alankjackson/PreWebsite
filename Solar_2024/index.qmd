##        Create various datasets

Having bought solar panels myself a few of years ago, and realizing
that the city permit database could be used to find most installations,
I decided that it would be interesting to look at the recent history and
a few other facets of residential solar panel installations.

The first step is to download the structural permit data as a CSV file
from [the city open data
site](https://www.houstontx.gov/planning/DevelopRegs/docs_pdfs/Permit_eReport/)
and clean it up. Details may be found on my [github
site](https://github.com/alankjackson/Curated_Data/blob/main/Clean_City_Permit_Addresses.Rmd),
or in the [data](../../Datasets/Houston_Permits/) section of this site.
The code for cleaning up the older data is in the file
Clean_old_City_permits.Rmd on that same github site.

## Grabbing the correct records

As far as I can tell, Solar Panels are designated as such in the
Description field, and nothing else. So a simple filter on "Solar"
should suffice to capture all the installation permits. In more recent
records, batteries are also flagged with tags like BATTERY, BATTERIES,
LITHIUM, LI-ION, or POWERWALL. Additionally, since about 2017 but more
consistently in recent years, the number of panels has been noted, so I
can use that as a way to estimate added capacity.

Generators use words like GENERATOR in the comments, and about half the time
also say whether the fuel is diesel or natural gas. Sometimes the power rating
is also given, in kilowatts. For some reason, residential generators do not seem
to appear in the permit database, even though they are required to get a permit.
That is a mystery.

And there are 2 installations of solar roof tiles.

```{r filter}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

#   Filter for various items - Solar really didn't begin until 2014

#   Solar panels
Solar <- df2 %>% 
  filter(Permit_date>"2013-12-31") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Comments, "SOLAR "))
#   Gas and diesel generators, but exclude cell towers
Generator <- df2 %>% 
  filter(Permit_date>"2013-12-31") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Comments, "GAS GEN|GENERAT")) %>% 
  filter(!str_detect(Comments, "CELL|TELECOM")) %>% 
  ungroup()
#   Try to decide if it is a residential or commercial generator
#     Assume >  10 kW is commercial
Generator <- Generator %>% 
  mutate(KW=str_extract(Comments, "[\\d,]* ?E?KW ")) %>% 
  mutate(KW=str_extract(KW, "[\\d,]+")) %>% 
  mutate(KW=str_remove(KW, ",")) %>% 
  mutate(KW=as.integer(KW)) %>% 
  mutate(Fuel=case_when(
    str_detect(Comments, "DIESEL") ~ "Diesel",
    str_detect(Comments, "GAS") ~ "Gas",
    .default = "UNK"
    )
  ) %>% 
  mutate(Fuel=as_factor(Fuel))

#   Car chargers
Charger <- df2 %>% 
  filter(Permit_date>"2013-12-31") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Comments, "CHARGING|CHARGER|CAR CHAR"))
#   Batteries
Battery <- df2 %>% 
  filter(Permit_date>"2013-12-31") %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Comments, "BATTER|LITHIUM|LI-ION|POWERWALL|ENERGY STOR"))

```

## Time series

So let's look at the growth in stuff over time. We'll consolidate to
monthly numbers to make the plot look descent.

Looks like a reasonable linear fit for solar, commercial generators basically 
flat.

Hmmm.... for batteries looks like a big jump not long after Valentines Day of 
2021. Why would that be?

## Look at amount of power capacity

We will use the number of panels (where noted) to get an idea of how
much kW capacity is being added. While capacity per panel varies, 300 watts
is not a bad average number.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

panels <- Solar %>% 
  mutate(Num_panels=
           as.numeric(
             str_extract(
               str_extract(Comments, "\\(\\d+\\)"),"\\d+"))) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(Comments, "RESID"),
         Num_panels<100,
         Num_panels>0)

panels %>% 
  ggplot()+
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Num_panels))

#   About 300 watts per panel

panels %>% 
  filter(Permit_date>ymd("2020-1-1")) %>% 
  mutate(Watts=300*Num_panels/1000)  %>% 
  mutate(By_Month=floor_date(Permit_date, unit="month")) %>%
  group_by(By_Month) %>%
    summarise(MonthlyTotal=sum(Watts)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=By_Month, y=MonthlyTotal))+
    geom_point()+
    geom_smooth() +
    labs(title="Monthly Residential Solar Panel Kilowatts in Houston",
         subtitle="For installations where the number of panels was noted", 
         x="Year", 
         y="Month Total")

#   Assume average 30 panels per install, at 300 watts per, so 9 kwatts per

Solar %>% 
  filter(year(Permit_date)>2020) %>% 
  mutate(By_Month=floor_date(Permit_date, unit="month")) %>%
  group_by(By_Month) %>%
    summarise(MonthlyTotal=n()) %>%
  mutate(Kwatts=MonthlyTotal*9) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=By_Month, y=Kwatts))+
    geom_point()+
    geom_smooth() +
    labs(title="Residential Solar Panel Total Estimated kW added in Houston",
         subtitle="Assuming 9 kW per install on average", 
         x="Year", 
         y="Month Total")

```

## Let's look at the distribution by Zip code

Surprisingly the Houston Arrow does not appear on this map. That is a
bit of a surprise. Note that 77048 is dominated by a property of
apartment homes that were built with a large solar array.

```{r by zip code}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

#   Top 20 zipcodes

Solar %>% 
  group_by(Zipcode) %>% 
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  dplyr::arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  dplyr::slice(1:20) %>% 
  gt::gt() %>% 
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Solar Panel Installations by Zip Code",
    subtitle = "2014 - present"
  ) %>% 
  gt::cols_label(
    Zipcode = "Zip Code",
    n = "Number of Installations"
  )

#    now let's make a map

zippath="/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Curated_Data_Files/Zipcodes/"
zips <- readRDS(paste0(zippath, "COH_Zip_Polys.rds")) %>% 
  mutate(Zipcode=as.character(ZIP_CODE)) %>% 
  sf::st_as_sf()


#   Number of permits per zip

solar_zip <- Solar %>% 
  group_by(Zipcode) %>% 
    summarise(Num = n()) %>% 
  mutate(Label=paste(as.character(Num) , "permits", Zipcode)) %>%
  mutate(Num=cut_width(Num, 50))

solar_zip <- right_join(zips, solar_zip, by="Zipcode")

# Create a factored palette function
pal <- leaflet::colorFactor(
  palette = "Blues",
  domain = solar_zip$Num)

leaflet::leaflet(solar_zip) %>% 
  leaflet::setView(lng = -95.362306, lat = 29.756931, zoom = 12) %>% 
  leaflet::addTiles() %>%
  leaflet::addPolygons(weight=1,
              fillColor = ~pal((Num)),
              fillOpacity = 0.5,
              label = ~Label) %>% 
  leaflet::addLegend("bottomleft", pal = pal, values = ~Num,
    title = "Num Permits",
    opacity = 1
  )

```

## Let's combine solar panels with assessments

Interestingly, it is clear that solar panels are not just for the
wealthy. The median value of homes with panels is pretty close to the
median value of homes in general. I used the 2021 HCAD total market
value for the value for each home.

There are some differences however. It appears that it roughly twice as
likely that a house worth over \$1,000,000 will have solar panels than a
house worth less than that.

```{r HCAD}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

HCADpath="/home/ajackson/Dropbox/Rprojects/Curated_Data_Files/HCAD/"
HCAD <- readRDS(paste0(HCADpath, "Values_2021.rds")) %>% 
  rename(Address=site_addr_1)

foo <- inner_join(Solar, HCAD, by="Address") %>% 
  mutate(Value=as.numeric(tot_mkt_val)) %>% 
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(state_class, "X")) %>% 
  select(Address, Zipcode, Permit_date, Comments, new_own_dt, Value, state_class)

foo %>% 
  filter(Value<2000000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=32)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  labs(title="Property Market Value",
       subtitle="For Properties with Solar Panels",
       x="Market Value",
       y="Number of Properties")

HCAD %>% 
  mutate(Value=as.numeric(tot_mkt_val)) %>% 
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(state_class, "X")) %>% 
  filter(Value<2000000) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Value)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=32)+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  labs(title="Property Market Value",
       subtitle="For All Properties",
       x="Market Value",
       y="Number of Properties")


foo2 <- HCAD %>%
  mutate(Value=as.numeric(tot_mkt_val)) %>%
  filter(!stringr::str_detect(state_class, "X")) %>%
  filter(Value<2000000) %>%
  mutate(Bins=cut_width(Value, 100000)) %>%
  group_by(Bins) %>%
    summarize(n=n())

foo %>% 
  filter(Value<2000000) %>% 
  mutate(Bins=cut_width(Value, 100000)) %>% 
  group_by(Bins) %>% 
    summarize(nsolar=n()) %>% 
  left_join(., foo2, by="Bins") %>% 
  mutate(Pct=nsolar/n) %>%
  cbind(., seq(0000, 2050000, 100000)) %>% 
  rename(Value=5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Value, y=Pct)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, stat="identity")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format()) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::percent) +
  labs(title="Property Market Value",
       subtitle="For All Properties",
       x="Market Value",
       y="Percent of Properties")
  
```

## Car charging

One final somewhat related topic - electric car chargers. These are all
commercial, I don't think residential chargers (220 volt) require a
permit. Looks like construction of chargoing stations is beginning to take off.

```{r chargers}
#| warning: false
#| message: false

Charger %>% 
  mutate(By_Month=floor_date(Permit_date, unit="month")) %>%
  group_by(By_Month) %>%
    summarise(MonthlyTotal=n()) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=By_Month, y=MonthlyTotal))+
    geom_point()+
    labs(title="Electric Car Charger Permits in Houston",
         subtitle="Monthly totals", 
         x="Year", 
         y="Month Total")

```
